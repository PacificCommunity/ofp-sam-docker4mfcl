\usage{
docker_run_mfcl2(
  image_name,
  commands,
  project_dir = getwd(),
  sub_dirs = NULL,
  parallel = FALSE,
  cores = parallel::detectCores() - 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{image_name}{The name of the Docker image (ignored in Condor mode).}

\item{commands}{A vector of command(s) to execute.}

\item{project_dir}{The base project directory to mount or work in. Defaults to the current working directory.}

\item{sub_dirs}{A list of subdirectories for execution. Defaults to NULL (only the base directory).}

\item{parallel}{Whether to enable parallel execution. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel execution. Defaults to all available cores minus one.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print the executed commands. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{log_file}{The log file to save the output. Defaults to NULL (no log file).}

\item{condor_mode}{Logical. If TRUE, run the commands locally (Condor mode) rather than inside Docker.}
}
\value{
A list of results from the executed commands.
}
\description{
This function executes MFCL-related commands either inside Docker containers (on Linux/macOS/Windows)
or, if running in Condor mode (when condor_mode = TRUE), it runs the commands directly on the system
without using Docker.
}
\examples{
# Docker mode (default)
docker_run_mfcl2(image_name = "mfcl_image", commands = "./mfclo64 input_file.frq")

# Condor mode: run commands locally (without Docker)
docker_run_mfcl2(image_name = "mfcl_image", commands = "./mfclo64 input_file.frq", condor_mode = TRUE)

}
